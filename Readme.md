This one is about bundling javascript, using Webpack, nodemon, express and json.

#Webpack RecordStore Homework

Take the RecordStore that was did in week 1 and create a browser UI for it. Create a sample.json which should be an array of objects to represent Records.

Just as we did with the Bank, create a new RecordStore and add all the records using the sample.json data and use a RecordStoreView to deal with the UI.

It should:

  - Display the name and city of the RecordStore
  - Display the inventory list

Further:

  - Add a FORM to add a new Record to the RecordStore.
  - Add ability to sell record
